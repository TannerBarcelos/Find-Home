# Movie Search App

### Idea
- The idea for this app was to build a ReactJS client that would proxy my own express API which in turn would interface with the TMDDB Movie/TV API.
- This project uses core concepts of conditional rendering in react, lifecycle hooks, 3rd party APIs and rendering data from external sources
- I learned a lot more about how to setup a proxy server to act as the middleman between a client and a server and how I could architect a system that extracts all server side logic like network requests, parsing urls, etc. to my own custom API while building a Client side app that only worries about state and rendering of data but not HOW to get the data. A fundamental layer of the abstraction layers of OOP

### Here is a demo of the application running
